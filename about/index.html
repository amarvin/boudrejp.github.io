        <p class="lead">In case you like a story...</p><br>
        <p>I'm a person that's been generally been interested in computers since I started gaming with them when I was young. That interest has taken a lot of forms over the years, beginning in high school when I was introduced to coding in Visual Basic and some software programs that dealt with mathematical concepts like <a href="https://www.dynamicgeometry.com/">Geometer's Sketchpad</a>. Having computers as a means to implement algorithmic solutions was really interesting back then, and still is now. I also came across <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Complexity.html?id=JTRJxYK_tZsC">Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos</a>, a book that further piqued my interest in the intersection of mathematics and computers. I knew this type of subject matter interested me but didn't know how to get into it without pursuing a PhD, which is a lot of commitment upfront when choosing a college major. I have some family in the chemical industry, who showed me some interesting aspects of chemical engineering. This ultimately ended up being my major at the University of Texas at Austin.</p> <br>
        <p>At UT, I simultaneously enjoyed and endured 4 years of engineering school. I had a few internships along the way, the first of which with a startup oil and gas company doing various things like accounting work and analyzing drill logs. This was followed by working in supply chain procurement for Solvay Chemicals. After that, I landed an internship with BASF where I got a lot more hands-on work with day-to-day operations of a utilities plant at the Geismar, Lousiana site. One of the more interesting aspects of that was performing analysis in various time scales, forecasting what savings alternative process technologies could provide. In the classroom, I mostly enjoyed classes that had programming elements like numerical methods. Outside of the classroom, I played 4 years of rugby for UT while holding officer positions like president and vice president.</p> <br>
        <p>Upon graduation, I took a full-time role with BASF. The role was intentionally multi-disciplinary, performing different job tasks for 8 months across different sites in order to find out more about the company and how I fit into it. I first started in the Detroit metro area, where this Texas native experienced his first winter while working on defect reduction projects in a discrete manufacturing operation. I utilized a lot of statistical concepts in a Lean Six Sigma context, which was a useful perspective to gain. After that, I came back home to Houston where I did some market analyst work for BASF's plasticizers business. In that role, I started finding that data collection, storage, and delivery had a lot of applications, and I had my first experience provisioning my own SQL DB in MS Access. I was lucky to find BASF's internal data science group and convince them to take me in for my last assignment. To prepare, I had to give myself a crash course in R and machine learning through <a href="http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/">Applied Predictive Modeling</a>. I found this role to be what I was looking for this whole time- finally combining the programming and mathematical aspects to chemical engineering. Honestly, if I had described what my dream job had been at the end of my undergraduate degree, it probably would look a lot like what I began doing in this assignment. </p> <br>
        <p>Since then, I've been doing the more or less same things as that assignment in a lot of different organizational manifestations: bringing data science to manufacturing use cases. To broaden my skill set past my self-educated crash course, I began pursuing UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science while still working full time, and I completed the degree in August 2020. All in the meantime, I've been able to develop several skillsets relevant to the data science space, like scoping problems, machine learning, experimentation, product development and deployment, containerization and orchestration, and a slew of others. I've also been lucky to be in positions to share these skills with others, both in the form of delivering trainings as well as mentoring and managing rotational program participants who are looking for experiences like the ones I've described.</p> <br>
        <p>These days, I've been looking to further develop some technical skill sets around side projects that I will be posting in much greater detail with blog posts on this site. Some of these include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Developing this website and showing dynamic visualizations in frameworks like D3</li>
          <li>Computer networking with a variety of projects involving raspberry pi's</li>
          <li>ML on edge devices, with projects involving my NVIDIA Jetson</li>
          <li>Time series applications</li>
          <li>Product development, API development, and algorithm development</li>
          <li>Reinforcement learning through making board game AIs</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>I approach data science from a pragmatic perspective, always wanting to make sure that my projects are aimed at some real-life use case (even if whimsical). There's a lot of hype in the field currently, and I'm always interested in making sure that hype turns into something tangible and real. </p> <br>
        <p>When I'm not coding or working on side projects, I can commonly be found spending time on other interests such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Playing board games (I have over 30 games, it's a problem)</li>
          <li>Cooking</li>
          <li>Making cocktails, with a special interest in Tiki drinks</li>
          <li>Looking after my plants</li>
          <li>Reading fiction and nonfiction</li>
          <li>PC Gaming (Age of Empires 2 + League of Legends mostly)</li>
          <li>Making and drinking coffee</li>
          <li>Watching live sports, with a focus on rugby + American football</li>
          <li>Enjoying the outdoors on bike or on foot</li>
        </ul>
